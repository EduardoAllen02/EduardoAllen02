Hi there! 🦾

My name is Eduardo, a software engineer based in Mexico.

I design and build whatever I can imagine, always prioritizing effectiveness, scalability, and software quality in every solution I develop.

My principal tech stack includes React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Three.js. My favorite tools are Blender, Notion, and the classic combo of paper and pencil for planning and creative exploration.

I’ve collaborated on full end-to-end solutions, from application design to backend development.

I enjoy staying flexible across technologies and constantly challenging myself with complex, ambitious projects.

Right now, I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push my skills further and blends creativity with engineering.

Fun Facts:

* Bleach is my all-time favorite anime.
* Also a blockchain enthusiast.
* Hobbies: gym, calisthenics, building videogames and 3D/AR experiences
